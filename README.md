Apache MXNet (incubating) is a deep learning framework designed for both *efficiency* and *flexibility*.
It allows you to ***mix*** [symbolic and imperative programming](http://mxnet.io/architecture/index.html#deep-learning-system-design-concepts)
to ***maximize*** efficiency and productivity.
At its core, MXNet contains a dynamic dependency scheduler that automatically parallelizes both symbolic and imperative operations on the fly.
A graph optimization layer on top of that makes symbolic execution fast and memory efficient.
MXNet is portable and lightweight, scaling effectively to multiple GPUs and multiple machines.

MXNet is also more than a deep learning project. It is also a collection of
[blue prints and guidelines](http://mxnet.io/architecture/index.html#deep-learning-system-design-concepts) for building
deep learning systems, and interesting insights of DL systems for hackers.

History
-------
MXNet emerged from a collaboration by the authors of [cxxnet](https://github.com/dmlc/cxxnet), [minerva](https://github.com/dmlc/minerva), and [purine2](https://github.com/purine/purine2). The project reflects what we have learned from the past projects. MXNet combines aspects of each of these projects to achieve flexibility, speed, and memory efficiency.
