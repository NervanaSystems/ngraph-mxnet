# This script will update the html content from building
# different tags.
# It assumes you have already run build_all_version.sh for
# the tags you want to update.

# Takes three arguments:
# * tag list - semicolon delimited list of tags to display on site; Example: "1.1.0;1.0.0;master"
# * default tag - which version should the site default to; Example: 1.0.0
# * root URL - for the versions dropdown to change to production or dev server; Example: http://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/

# Example Usage:
# ./update_all_version.sh "1.1.0;1.0.0;master" 1.0.0 http://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/
