# Installing MXNet in Windows

On Windows, you can download and install the prebuilt MXNet package, or download, build, and install MXNet yourself.

## Build the Shared Library
You can either use a prebuilt binary package or build from source to build the MXNet shared library - ```libmxnet.dll```.

### Installing the Prebuilt Package on Windows
MXNet provides a prebuilt package for Windows. The prebuilt package includes the MXNet library, all of the dependent third-party libraries, a sample C++ solution for Visual Studio, and the Python installation script. To install the prebuilt package:

1. Download the latest prebuilt package from the [Releases](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/releases) tab of MXNet.
2. Unpack the package into a folder, with an appropriate name, such as ```D:\MXNet```.
3. Open the folder, and install the package by double-clicking ```setupenv.cmd```. This sets up all of the environment variables required by MXNet.
4. Test the installation by opening the provided sample C++ Visual Studio solution and building it.


&nbsp;
This produces a library called ```libmxnet.dll```.

### Building and Installing Packages on Windows

To build and install MXNet yourself, you need the following dependencies. Install the required dependencies:

1. If [Microsoft Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/older-downloads/) is not already installed, download and install it. You can download and install the free community edition.
2. Download and Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/) if it is not already installed.
3. Download and install [OpenCV](http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-win/3.0.0/opencv-3.0.0.exe/download).
4. Unzip the OpenCV package.
5. Set the environment variable ```OpenCV_DIR``` to point to the ```OpenCV build directory``` (```C:\opencv\build\x64\vc14``` for example). Also, you need to add the OpenCV bin directory (```C:\opencv\build\x64\vc14\bin``` for example) to the ``PATH`` variable.
6. If you have Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL) installed, set ```MKL_ROOT``` to point to ```MKL``` directory that contains the ```include``` and ```lib```. Typically, you can find the directory in
```C:\Program Files (x86)\IntelSWTools\compilers_and_libraries_2018\windows\mkl```.
7. If you don't have the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL) installed, download and install [OpenBlas](http://sourceforge.net/projects/openblas/files/v0.2.14/).
8. Set the environment variable ```OpenBLAS_HOME``` to point to the ```OpenBLAS``` directory that contains the ```include``` and ```lib``` directories. Typically, you can find the directory in ```C:\Program files (x86)\OpenBLAS\```.
9. Download and install [CuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn). To get access to the download link, register as an NVIDIA community user.

After you have installed all of the required dependencies, build the MXNet source code:

1. Download the MXNet source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet). Don't forget to pull the submodules:
```
    git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet.git --recursive
```
2. Start a Visual Studio command prompt.
3. Use [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to create a Visual Studio solution in ```./build``` or some other directory. Make sure to specify the architecture in the
[CMake](https://cmake.org/) command:
```
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 Win64" ..
```
4. In Visual Studio, open the solution file,```.sln```, and compile it.
These commands produce a library called ```mxnet.dll``` in the ```./build/Release/``` or ```./build/Debug``` folder.



&nbsp;
Next, we install ```graphviz``` library that we use for visualizing network graphs you build on MXNet. We will also install [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/)  used for running MXNet tutorials and examples.
- Install ```graphviz``` by downloading MSI installer from [Graphviz Download Page](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/_pages/Download/Download_windows.html).
**Note** Make sure to add graphviz executable path to PATH environment variable. Refer [here for more details](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35064304/runtimeerror-make-sure-the-graphviz-executables-are-on-your-systems-path-aft)
- Install ```Jupyter``` by installing [Anaconda for Python 2.7](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
**Note** Do not install Anaconda for Python 3.5. MXNet has few compatibility issue with Python 3.5.

&nbsp;

We have installed MXNet core library. Next, we will install MXNet interface package for programming language of your choice:
- [Python](#install-the-mxnet-package-for-python)
- [R](#install-mxnet-for-r)
- [Julia](#install-the-mxnet-package-for-julia)
- **Scala** is not yet available for Windows

## Install MXNet for Python

1. Install ```Python``` using windows installer available [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2712/).
2. Install ```Numpy``` using windows installer available [here](http://scipy.org/install.html).
3. Next, we install Python package interface for MXNet. You can find the Python interface package for [MXNet on GitHub](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/tree/master/python/mxnet).

```bash
    # Assuming you are in root mxnet source code folder
    cd python
    sudo python setup.py install
```
Done! We have installed MXNet with Python interface. Run below commands to verify our installation is successful.
```bash
    # Open Python terminal
    python

    # You should be able to import mxnet library without any issues.
    >>> import mxnet as mx;
    >>> a = mx.nd.ones((2, 3));
    >>> print ((a*2).asnumpy());
        [[ 2.  2.  2.]
        [ 2.  2.  2.]]
```
We actually did a small tensor computation using MXNet! You are all set with MXNet on your Windows machine.

## Install MXNet for R
MXNet for R is available for both CPUs and GPUs.

### Installing MXNet on a Computer with a CPU Processor

To install MXNet on a computer with a CPU processor, choose from two options:

* Use the prebuilt binary package
* Build the library from source code

#### Installing MXNet with the Prebuilt Binary Package
For Windows users, MXNet provides prebuilt binary packages.
You can install the package directly in the R console.

For CPU-only package:

```r
  cran <- getOption("repos")
  cran["dmlc"] <- "https://apache-mxnet.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/R/CRAN/"
  options(repos = cran)
  install.packages("mxnet")
```

For GPU-enabled package:

```r
  cran <- getOption("repos")
  cran["dmlc"] <- "https://apache-mxnet.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/R/CRAN/GPU"
  options(repos = cran)
  install.packages("mxnet")
```

#### Building MXNet from Source Code

Run the following commands to install the MXNet dependencies and build the MXNet R package.

```r
  Rscript -e "install.packages('devtools', repo = 'https://cloud.r-project.org/')"
```

```bash
  cd R-package
  Rscript -e "library(devtools); library(methods); options(repos=c(CRAN='https://cloud.r-project.org/')); install_deps(dependencies = TRUE)"
  cd ..
  make rpkg
```

### Installing MXNet on a Computer with a GPU Processor

To install MXNet R package on a computer with a GPU processor, you need the following:

* Microsoft Visual Studio 2013

* The NVidia CUDA Toolkit

* The MXNet package

* CuDNN (to provide a Deep Neural Network library)

To install the required dependencies and install MXNet for R:

1. Install the [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit). The CUDA Toolkit depends on Visual Studio. To check whether your GPU is compatible with the CUDA Toolkit and for information on installing it, see NVidia's [CUDA Installation Guide](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/).
3. Clone the MXNet github repo.

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet
```

The `--recursive` is to clone all the submodules used by MXNet. You will be editing the ```"/mxnet/R-package"``` folder.
4. Download prebuilt GPU-enabled MXNet libraries for Windows from https://github.com/yajiedesign/mxnet/releases. You will need `mxnet_x64_vc14_gpu.7z` and `prebuildbase_win10_x64_vc14.7z`.
5. Download and install [CuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn).
6. Create a folder called ```R-package/inst/libs/x64```. MXNet supports only 64-bit operating systems, so you need the x64 folder.
7. Copy the following shared libraries (.dll files) into the ```R-package/inst/libs/x64``` folder:
```
cublas64_80.dll
cudart64_80.dll
cudnn64_5.dll
curand64_80.dll
libgcc_s_seh-1.dll
libgfortran-3.dll
libmxnet.dll
libmxnet.lib
libopenblas.dll
libquadmath-0.dll
nvrtc64_80.dll
```
These dlls can be found in `prebuildbase_win10_x64_vc14/3rdparty/cudart`, `prebuildbase_win10_x64_vc14/3rdparty/openblas/bin`, `mxnet_x64_vc14_gpu/build`, `mxnet_x64_vc14_gpu/lib` and the `cuDNN` downloaded from NVIDIA.
8. Copy the header files from `dmlc`, `mxnet` and `nnvm` into `./R-package/inst/include`. It should look like:

```
./R-package/inst
└── include
    ├── dmlc
    ├── mxnet
    └── nnvm
```
9. Make sure that R is added to your ```PATH``` in the environment variables. Running the ```where R``` command at the command prompt should return the location.
10. Now open the Windows CMD and change the directory to the `mxnet` folder. Then use the following commands
to build R package:

```bat
echo import(Rcpp) > R-package\NAMESPACE
echo import(methods) >> R-package\NAMESPACE
Rscript -e "install.packages('devtools', repos = 'https://cloud.r-project.org')"
cd R-package
Rscript -e "library(devtools); library(methods); options(repos=c(CRAN='https://cloud.r-project.org')); install_deps(dependencies = TRUE)"
cd ..

R CMD INSTALL --no-multiarch R-package

Rscript -e "require(mxnet); mxnet:::mxnet.export('R-package')"
rm R-package/NAMESPACE
Rscript -e "require(devtools); install_version('roxygen2', version = '5.0.1', repos = 'https://cloud.r-project.org/', quiet = TRUE)"
Rscript -e "require(roxygen2); roxygen2::roxygenise('R-package')"

R CMD INSTALL --build --no-multiarch R-package
```

**Note:** To maximize its portability, the MXNet library is built with the Rcpp end. Computers running Windows need [MSVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_C%2B%2B) (Microsoft Visual C++) to handle CUDA toolchain compatibilities.

## Install the MXNet Package for Julia
The MXNet package for Julia is hosted in a separate repository, MXNet.jl, which is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/dmlc/MXNet.jl). To use Julia binding it with an existing libmxnet installation, set the ```MXNET_HOME``` environment variable by running the following command:

```bash
export MXNET_HOME=/<path to>/libmxnet
```

The path to the existing libmxnet installation should be the root directory of libmxnet. In other words, you should be able to find the ```libmxnet.so``` file at ```$MXNET_HOME/lib```. For example, if the root directory of libmxnet is ```~```, you would run the following command:

```bash
	export MXNET_HOME=/~/libmxnet
```

You might want to add this command to your ```~/.bashrc``` file. If you do, you can install the Julia package in the Julia console using the following command:

```julia
	Pkg.add("MXNet")
```

For more details about installing and using MXNet with Julia, see the [MXNet Julia documentation](http://dmlc.ml/MXNet.jl/latest/user-guide/install/).

## Installing the MXNet Package for Scala

Scala-MXNet is not yet available for Windows.
