## File a bug report

Please let us know if you experienced a problem with MXNet. Please provide detailed information about the problem you encountered and, if possible, add a description that helps to reproduce the problem. You have two alternatives for filing a bug report:
<p><a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MXNet"><i class="fas fa-bug"></i> JIRA</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues"><i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub</a></p>


## Minor Fixes

If you have found an issue and would like to contribute a bug fix or documentation update, follow these guidelines:

* If it is trivial, just create a [pull request](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pulls).
* If it is non-trivial, you should follow the [formal pull request process](#formal-pull-request-process) described in the next section.


## Formal Pull Request Process

Any new features of improvements that are non-trivial should follow the complete flow of:

1. [Review the contribution standards](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Development+Process) for your type of submission.
1. [Create a JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa).
1. [Create the PR on GitHub](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pulls) and add the JIRA issue ID to the PR's title.

Further details on this process can be found on the [Wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Development).


## New Feature Process

Our community is constantly looking for feedback to improve Apache MXNet. If you have an idea how to improve MXNet or have a new feature in mind that would be beneficial for MXNet users, please open an issue in [MXNetâ€™s JIRA](http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MXNet). The improvement or new feature should be described in appropriate detail and include the scope and its requirements if possible. Detailed information is important for a few reasons:<br/>
- It ensures your requirements are met when the improvement or feature is implemented.<br/>
- It helps to estimate the effort and to design a solution that addresses your needs. <br/>
- It allows for constructive discussions that might arise around this issue.

Detailed information is also required, if you plan to contribute the improvement or feature you proposed yourself. Please read the [contributions](http://mxnet.io/community/contribute.html) guide in this case as well.

MXNet is evolving fast. To see what's next and what the community is currently working on, check out the Roadmap issues on GitHub and the JIRA Boards:
