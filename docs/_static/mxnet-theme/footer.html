            Apache MXNet is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), <strong>sponsored by the <i>Apache Incubator</i></strong>. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
