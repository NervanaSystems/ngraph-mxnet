=head1

    NameManager that does an automatic naming.

    A user can also inherit this object to change the naming behavior.
=cut

has 'counter' => (
    is => 'ro',
    isa => 'HashRef',
    default => sub { +{} }
);

our $current;

=head2 get

    Get the canonical name for a symbol.

    This is default implementation.
    When user specified a name,
    the user specified name will be used.

    When user did not, we will automatically generate a
    name based on hint string.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str or undef
        The name the user has specified.

    hint : str
        A hint string, which can be used to generate name.

    Returns
    -------
    full_name : str
        A canonical name for the symbol.
