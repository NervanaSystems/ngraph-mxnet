# MXNet C++ Package Inference Workflow Examples

## Building C++ Inference examples

The examples in this folder demonstrate the **inference** workflow. Please build the MXNet C++ Package as explained in the [README](<https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/cpp-package#building-c-package>) File before building these examples.
To build examples use following commands:

-  Release: **make all**
-  Debug: **make debug all**


## Examples demonstrating inference workflow

This directory contains following examples. In order to run the examples, ensure that the path to the MXNet shared library is added to the OS specific environment variable viz. **LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH** for Linux, Mac and Ubuntu OS and **PATH** for Windows OS.

### [inception_inference.cpp](<https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/cpp-package/example/inference/inception_inference.cpp>)

This example demonstrates image classification workflow with pre-trained models using MXNet C++ API. The command line parameters the example can accept are as shown below:

```
./inception_inference --help
Usage:
inception_inference --symbol <model symbol file in json format>
                    --params <model params file>
					--image <path to the image used for prediction
					--synset file containing labels for prediction
					[--input_shape <dimensions of input image e.g "3 224 224"]
					[--mean file containing mean image for normalizing the input image
					[--gpu] Specify this option if workflow needs to be run in gpu context
```
The model json and param file and synset files are required to run this example.  The sample command line is as follows:

```

./inception_inference --symbol "./model/Inception-BN-symbol.json" --params "./model/Inception-BN-0126.params" --synset "./model/synset.txt" --mean "./model/mean_224.nd" --image "./model/dog.jpg"
```
Alternatively, The script [unit_test_inception_inference.sh](<https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/cpp-package/example/inference/unit_test_inception_inference.sh>) downloads the pre-trained **Inception** model and a test image. The users can invoke this script as follows:

```
./unit_test_inception_inference.sh
```

### [sentiment_analysis_rnn.cpp](<https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/cpp-package/example/inference/sentiment_analysis_rnn.cpp>)
This example demonstrates how you can load a pre-trained RNN model and use it to predict the sentiment expressed in the given movie review with the MXNet C++ API. The example is capable of processing variable legnth inputs. It performs the following tasks
- Loads the pre-trained RNN model.
- Loads the dictionary file containing the word to index mapping.
- Splits the review in multiple lines separated by "."
- The example predicts the sentiment score for individual lines and outputs the average score.

The example is capable of processing variable length input by implementing following technique:
- The example creates executors for pre-determined input lenghts such as 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc called **buckets**.
- Each bucket is identified by **bucket-key** representing the length on input required by corresponding executor.
- For each line in the review, the example finds the number of words in the line and tries to find a closest bucket or executor.
- If the bucket key does not match the number of words in the line, the example pads or trims the input line to match the required length.

The example uses a pre-trained RNN model trained with a IMDB dataset. The RNN model was built by exercising the [GluonNLP Sentiment Analysis Tutorial](<http://gluon-nlp.mxnet.io/examples/sentiment_analysis/sentiment_analysis.html#>). The tutorial uses 'standard_lstm_lm_200' available in Gluon Model Zoo and fine tunes it for the IMDB dataset
The model consists of :
- Embedding Layer
- 2 LSTM Layers with hidden dimension size of 200
- Average pooling layer
- Sigmoid output layer
The model was trained for 10 epochs to achieve 85% test accuracy.
The visual representation of the model is [here](<http://gluon-nlp.mxnet.io/examples/sentiment_analysis/sentiment_analysis.html#Sentiment-analysis-model-with-pre-trained-language-model-encoder>).

The model files can be found here.
- [sentiment_analysis-symbol.json](< https://s3.amazonaws.com/mxnet-cpp/RNN_model/sentiment_analysis-symbol.json>)
- [sentiment_analysis-0010.params](< https://s3.amazonaws.com/mxnet-cpp/RNN_model/sentiment_analysis-0010.params>)
- [sentiment_token_to_idx.txt](<https://s3.amazonaws.com/mxnet-cpp/RNN_model/sentiment_token_to_idx.txt>) Each line of the dictionary file contains a word and a unique index for that word, separated by a space, with a total of 32787 words generated from the training dataset.
The example downloads the above files while running.

The example's command line parameters are as shown below:

```
./sentiment_analysis_rnn --help
Usage:
sentiment_analysis_rnn
--input Input movie review. The review can be single line or multiline.e.g. "This movie is the best." OR  "This movie is the best. The direction is awesome."
[--gpu]  Specify this option if workflow needs to be run in gpu context
If the review is multiline, the example predicts sentiment score for each line and the final score is the average of scores obtained for each line.

```

The following command line shows running the example with the movie review containing only one line.

```
./sentiment_analysis_rnn --input "This movie has the great story"
```

The above command will output the sentiment score as follows:
```
sentiment_analysis_rnn.cpp:346: Input Line : [This movie has the great story] Score : 0.999898
sentiment_analysis_rnn.cpp:449: The sentiment score between 0 and 1, (1 being positive)=0.999898
```

The following command line shows invoking the example with the multi-line review.

```
./sentiment_analysis_rnn --input "This movie is the best. The direction is awesome."
```
The above command will output the sentiment score for each line in the review and average score as follows:
```
Input Line : [This movie is the best] Score : 0.964498
Input Line : [ The direction is awesome] Score : 0.968855
The sentiment score between 0 and 1, (1 being positive)=0.966677
```

Alternatively, you can run the [unit_test_sentiment_analysis_rnn.sh](<https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/cpp-package/example/inference/unit_test_sentiment_analysis_rnn.sh>) script.
