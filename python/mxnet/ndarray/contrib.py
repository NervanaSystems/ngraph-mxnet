def rand_zipfian(true_classes, num_sampled, range_max, ctx=None):
    """Draw random samples from an approximately log-uniform or Zipfian distribution.

    This operation randomly samples *num_sampled* candidates the range of integers [0, range_max).
    The elements of sampled_candidates are drawn with replacement from the base distribution.

    The base distribution for this operator is an approximately log-uniform or Zipfian distribution:

    P(class) = (log(class + 2) - log(class + 1)) / log(range_max + 1)

    This sampler is useful when the true classes approximately follow such a distribution.
    For example, if the classes represent words in a lexicon sorted in decreasing order of \
    frequency. If your classes are not ordered by decreasing frequency, do not use this op.

    Additionaly, it also returns the number of times each of the \
    true classes and the sampled classes is expected to occur.

    Parameters
    ----------
    true_classes : NDArray
        A 1-D NDArray of the target classes.
    num_sampled: int
        The number of classes to randomly sample.
    range_max: int
        The number of possible classes.
    ctx : Context
        Device context of output. Default is current context.

    Returns
    -------
    samples: NDArray
        The sampled candidate classes in 1-D `int64` dtype.
    expected_count_true: NDArray
        The expected count for true classes in 1-D `float64` dtype.
    expected_count_sample: NDArray
        The expected count for sampled candidates in 1-D `float64` dtype.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> true_cls = mx.nd.array([3])
    >>> samples, exp_count_true, exp_count_sample = mx.nd.contrib.rand_zipfian(true_cls, 4, 5)

def foreach(body, data, init_states):
    """Run a for loop with user-defined computation over NDArrays on dimension 0.

    This operator simulates a for loop and body has the computation for an iteration
    of the for loop. It runs the computation in body on each slice from the input
    NDArrays.

    body takes two arguments as input and outputs a tuple of two elements,
    as illustrated below:

    out, states = body(data1, states)

    data1 can be either an NDArray or a list of NDArrays. If data is an NDArray,
    data1 is an NDArray. Otherwise, data1 is a list of NDArrays and has the same
    size as data. states is a list of NDArrays and have the same size as init_states.
    Similarly, out can be either an NDArray or a list of NDArrays, which are concatenated
    as the first output of foreach; states from the last execution of body
    are the second output of foreach.

    The computation done by this operator is equivalent to the pseudo code below
    when the input data is NDArray:

    states = init_states
    outs = []
    for i in data.shape[0]:
        s = data[i]
        out, states = body(s, states)
        outs.append(out)
    outs = stack(*outs)


    Parameters
    ----------
    body : a Python function.
        Define computation in an iteration.
    data: an NDArray or a list of NDArrays.
        The input data.
    init_states: an NDArray or a list of NDArrays.
        The initial values of the loop states.
    name: string.
        The name of the operator.

    Returns
    -------
    outputs: an NDArray or a list of NDArrays.
        The output data concatenated from the output of all iterations.
    states: a list of NDArrays.
        The loop states in the last iteration.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> step = lambda data, states: (data + states[0], [states[0] * 2])
    >>> data = mx.nd.random.uniform(shape=(2, 10))
    >>> states = [mx.nd.random.uniform(shape=(10))]
    >>> outs, states = mx.nd.contrib.foreach(step, data, states)
