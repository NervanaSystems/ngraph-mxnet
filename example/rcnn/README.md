# Faster R-CNN in MXNet with distributed implementation and data parallelization

![example detections](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13162287/22101032/92085dc0-de6c-11e6-9228-67e72606ddbc.png)

## Why?
There exist good implementations of Faster R-CNN yet they lack support for recent 
ConvNet architectures. The aim of reproducing it from scratch is to fully utilize 
MXNet engines and parallelization for object detection.

| Indicator | py-faster-rcnn (caffe resp.) | mx-rcnn (this reproduction) |
| :-------- | :--------------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| Speed [1] | 2.5 img/s training, 5 img/s testing | 3.8 img/s in training, 12.5 img/s testing |
| Performance [2] | mAP 73.2               | mAP 75.97                   |
| Efficiency [3]  | 11G for Fast R-CNN     | 4.6G for Fast R-CNN         |
| Parallelization  [4] | None              | 3.8 img/s to 6 img/s for 2 GPUs |
| Extensibility [5] | Old framework and base networks | ResNet           |

[1] On Ubuntu 14.04.5 with device Titan X, cuDNN enabled.
    The experiment is VGG-16 end-to-end training.  
[2] VGG network. Trained end-to-end on VOC07trainval+12trainval, tested on VOC07 test.  
[3] VGG network. Fast R-CNN is the most memory expensive process.  
[4] VGG network (parallelization limited by bandwidth).
    ResNet-101 speeds up from 2 img/s to 3.5 img/s.  
[5] py-faster-rcnn does not support ResNet or recent caffe version.

## Why Not?
* If you value stability and reproducibility over performance and efficiency, please refer to official implementations.
  There is no promise in all cases nor all experiments.
* If you value simplicity. Technical details are *very complicated* in MXNet.
  This is by design to attain maximum possible performance instead of patching fixes after fixes.
  Performance and parallelization are more than a change of parameter.
* If you want to do CPU training, be advised that it has not been verified properly yet. You can change the `ctx` variable in `train_end2end.py` or `train_alternate.py` scripts to `mx.cpu` and run these scripts directly to test it.
* If you are on Windows some people reported it was possible with some modifications. But they have disappeared.

The above experiments were conducted at [mx-rcnn](https://github.com/precedenceguo/mx-rcnn/tree/6a1ab0eec5035a10a1efb5fc8c9d6c54e101b4d0)
using [a MXNet fork, based on MXNet 0.9.1 nnvm pre-release](https://github.com/precedenceguo/mxnet/tree/simple).

## Quickstart
* Prepare: `bash script/additional_deps.sh`
* Download training data: `bash script/get_voc.sh`
* Download pretrained model: `bash script/get_pretrained_model.sh`
* Training and testing: `bash script/vgg_voc07.sh 0,1` (this means to use gpu 0 and 1)

## Prerequisites
* Pip, Python-dev, Unzip
* Some python packages are required: Cython, Scikit-image, Easydict, Matplot, OpenCV, Future
* On debian, you can usually run `sudo apt install python-pip python-dev unzip`
* And the python packages can be installed by running `sudo pip install cython scikit-image easydict matplotlib opencv-python future`. Note that you may have to remove sudo depending on how your mxnet package is installed.
* MXNet version v0.9.5 or higher with Python interface installed. Open `python` type `import mxnet` to confirm.

## Getting started
* Suppose `HOME` represents where this file is located. All commands, unless stated otherwise, should be started from `HOME`.
* Ensure that `bash script/additional_deps.sh` installs all prerequisites listed above. If you're not using this script, ensure above prerequisities are present on your system and then run `make` from `HOME`. This builds the cython extensions and installs python bindings for them.

Command line arguments have the same meaning as in mxnet/example/image-classification.
* `prefix` refers to the first part of a saved model file name and `epoch` refers to a number in this file name.
  In `model/vgg-0000.params`, `prefix` is `"model/vgg"` and `epoch` is `0`.
* `begin_epoch` means the start of your training process, which will apply to all saved checkpoints.
* Remember to turn off cudnn auto tune. `export MXNET_CUDNN_AUTOTUNE_DEFAULT=0`.

## Demo (Pascal VOC)
* An example of trained model (trained on VOC07 trainval) can be accessed from  
  [Baidu Yun](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1boRhGvH) (ixiw) or 
  [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jrr83q0ai2ckltq/final-0000.params.tar.gz?dl=0).
  If you put the extracted model `final-0000.params` in `HOME` then use `--prefix final --epoch 0` to access it. 
* Try out detection result by running `python demo.py --prefix final --epoch 0 --image myimage.jpg --gpu 0 --vis`.
  Drop the `--vis` if you do not have a display or want to save as a new file.

## Training Faster R-CNN
The following tutorial is based on VOC data, VGG network. Supply `--network resnet` and 
`--dataset coco` to use other networks and datasets.
Refer to `script/vgg_voc07.sh` and other experiments for examples.

### Prepare Training Data
See `bash script/get_voc.sh` and `bash script/get_coco.sh` will do the following for you.
* Make a folder `data` in `HOME`. `data` folder will be used to place the training data folder `VOCdevkit` and `coco`.
* Download and extract [Pascal VOC data](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/), place the `VOCdevkit` folder in `HOME/data`.
* Download and extract [coco dataset](http://mscoco.org/dataset/), place all images to `coco/images` and annotation jsons to `data/annotations`.

(Skip this if not interested) All dataset have three attributes, `image_set`, `root_path` and `dataset_path`.  
* `image_set` could be `2007_trainval` or something like `2007trainval+2012trainval`.  
* `root_path` is usually `data`, where `cache`, `selective_search_data`, `rpn_data` will be stored.  
* `dataset_path` could be something like `data/VOCdevkit`, where images, annotations and results can be put so that many copies of datasets can be linked to the same actual place.    

### Prepare Pretrained Models
See if `bash script/get_pretrained_model.sh` will do this for you. If not,
* Make a folder `model` in `HOME`. `model` folder will be used to place model checkpoints along the training process. 
  It is recommended to set `model` as a symbolic link to somewhere else in hard disk.
* Download VGG16 pretrained model `vgg16-0000.params` from [MXNet model gallery](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet-model-gallery/blob/master/imagenet-1k-vgg.md) to `model` folder.
* Download ResNet pretrained model `resnet-101-0000.params` from [ResNet](https://github.com/tornadomeet/ResNet) to `model` folder.

### Alternate Training
See if `bash script/vgg_alter_voc07.sh 0` (use gpu 0) will do the following for you.
* Start training by running `python train_alternate.py`. This will train the VGG network on the VOC07 trainval.
  More control of training process can be found in the argparse help.
* Start testing by running `python test.py --prefix model/final --epoch 0` after completing the training process.
  This will test the VGG network on the VOC07 test with the model in `HOME/model/final-0000.params`.
  Adding a `--vis` will turn on visualization and `-h` will show help as in the training process.

### End-to-end Training (approximate process)
See if `bash script/vgg_voc07.sh 0` (use gpu 0) will do the following for you.
* Start training by running `python train_end2end.py`. This will train the VGG network on VOC07 trainval.
* Start testing by running `python test.py`. This will test the VGG network on the VOC07 test.

## Training Fast R-CNN (legacy from the initial version)
See if `bash script/get_selective.sh` and `bash script/vgg_fast_rcnn.sh 0` (use gpu 0) will do the following for you.
* To reproduce Fast R-CNN, `scipy` is used to load selective search proposals.
* Download [precomputed selective search data](https://github.com/rbgirshick/fast-rcnn/tree/master/data) and place them to `data` folder.
  `script/get_selective_search.sh` will do this.
* Start training by running `python -m rcnn.tools.train_rcnn --proposal selective_search` to use the selective search proposal.
* Start testing by running `python -m rcnn.tools.test_rcnn --proposal selective_search`.
* `script/vgg_fast_rcnn.sh` will train Fast R-CNN on VOC07 and test on VOC07test.

## What is Faster R-CNN, anyway?
Region Proposal Network solves object detection as a regression problem 
from the objectness perspective. Bounding boxes are predicted by applying 
learned bounding box deltas to base boxes, namely anchor boxes across 
different positions in feature maps. Training process directly learns a 
mapping from raw image intensities to bounding box transformation targets.

Fast R-CNN treats general object detection as a classification problem and
bounding box prediction as a regression problem. Classifying cropped region
feature maps and predicting bounding box displacements together yields
detection results. Cropping feature maps instead of image input accelerates
computation utilizing shared convolution maps. Bounding box displacements
are simultaneously learned in the training process.

Faster R-CNN utilize an alternate optimization training process between RPN 
and Fast R-CNN. Fast R-CNN weights are used to initiate RPN for training.
The approximate joint training scheme does not backpropagate rcnn training
error to rpn training.
