## Wide and Deep Learning

The example demonstrates how to train [wide and deep model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07792). The [Census Income Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income) that this example uses for training is hosted by the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/). Tricks of feature engineering are adapted from tensorflow's [wide and deep tutorial](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/wide_deep).

The final accuracy should be around 85%.
