Scale learning rates by the ratio of accumulated gradients to accumulated
updates, see [1] and notes for further description.

### Attributes
* `η`: default `1.0`, learning rate.
* `ρ`: default `0.95`, squared gradient moving average decay factor.
* `ϵ`: default `1e-6`, small value added for numerical stability.
* `clip`: default `0`, gradient clipping.
  If positive, will clip the gradient into the range `[-clip, clip]`.
* `scale`: default `0`, gradient rescaling.
  If != 0, multiply the gradient with `scale` before updating.
  Often choose to be `1.0 / batch_size`.
  If leave it default, high-level API like `fit!` will set it to
  `1.0 / batch_size`, since `fit!` knows the `batch_size`.
* `λ`: default `0.00001`, weight decay is equivalent
  to adding a global l2 regularizer for all the parameters.

### Notes
`ρ` should be between 0 and 1. A value of `ρ` close to 1 will decay the
moving average slowly and a value close to 0 will decay the moving average
fast.

`ρ = 0.95` and `ϵ = 1e-6` are suggested in the paper and reported to
work for multiple datasets (MNIST, speech). In the paper, no learning rate is
considered (so `η = 1.0`). Probably best to keep it at this value.

`ϵ` is important for the very first update (so the numerator does not become 0).

Using the step size `η` and a decay factor `ρ` the learning rate is
calculated as:

```math
\begin{align*}
  r_t &= ρ r_{t-1} + (1 - ρ) g^2 \\
  η_t &= η \frac{\sqrt{s_{t-1} + ϵ}} {\sqrt{r_t + ϵ}} \\
  s_t &= ρ s_{t-1} + (1 - ρ) (η_t \times g)^2
\end{align*}
```
