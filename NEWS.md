MXNet Change Log
================
## 0.12.0
### Performance
  - Added full support for NVIDIA Volta GPU Architecture and CUDA 9. Training is up to 3.5x faster than Pascal when using float16.
  - Enabled JIT compilation. Autograd and Gluon hybridize now use less memory and has faster speed. Performance is almost the same with old symbolic style code.
  - Improved ImageRecordIO image loading performance and added indexed RecordIO support.
  - Added better openmp thread management to improve CPU performance.
### New Features - Gluon
  - Added enhancements to the Gluon package, a high-level interface designed to be easy to use while keeping most of the flexibility of low level API. Gluon supports both imperative and symbolic programming, making it easy to train complex models imperatively with minimal impact on performance. Neural networks (and other machine learning models) can be defined and trained with `gluon.nn` and `gluon.rnn` packages. 
  - Added new loss functions - `SigmoidBinaryCrossEntropyLoss`, `CTCLoss`, `HuberLoss`, `HingeLoss`, `SquaredHingeLoss`, `LogisticLoss`, `TripletLoss`.
  - `gluon.Trainer` now allows reading and setting learning rate with `trainer.learning_rate` property.
  - Added API `HybridBlock.export` for exporting gluon models to MXNet format.
  - Added `gluon.contrib` package.
    - Convolutional recurrent network cells for RNN, LSTM and GRU.
    - `VariationalDropoutCell`
### New Features - Autograd
  - Added enhancements to `autograd` package, which enables automatic differentiation of NDArray operations.
  - `autograd.Function` allows defining both forward and backward computation for custom operators.
  - Added `mx.autograd.grad` and experimental second order gradient support (most operators don't support second order gradient yet).
  - Autograd now supports cross-device graphs. Use `x.copyto(mx.gpu(i))` and `x.copyto(mx.cpu())` to do computation on multiple devices.
### New Features - Sparse Tensor Support
  - Added support for sparse matrices. 
  - Added limited cpu support for two sparse formats in `Symbol` and `NDArray` - `CSRNDArray` and `RowSparseNDArray`.
  - Added a sparse dot product operator and many element-wise sparse operators.
  - Added a data iterator for sparse data input - `LibSVMIter`.
  - Added three optimizers for sparse gradient updates: `Ftrl`, `SGD` and `Adam`.
  - Added `push` and `row_sparse_pull` with `RowSparseNDArray` in distributed kvstore.
### Other New Features
  - Added limited support for fancy indexing, which allows you to very quickly access and modify complicated subsets of an array's values. `x[idx_arr0, idx_arr1, ..., idx_arrn]` is now supported. Features such as combining and slicing are planned for the next release. Checkout master to get a preview.
  - Random number generators in `mx.nd.random.*` and `mx.sym.random.*` now support both CPU and GPU.
  - `NDArray` and `Symbol` now supports "fluent" methods. You can now use `x.exp()` etc instead of `mx.nd.exp(x)` or `mx.sym.exp(x)`.
  - Added `mx.rtc.CudaModule` for writing and running CUDA kernels from python. 
  - Added `multi_precision` option to optimizer for easier float16 training.
  - Better support for IDE auto-completion. IDEs like PyCharm can now correctly parse mxnet operators.
### API Changes
  - Operators like `mx.sym.linalg_*` and `mx.sym.random_*` are now moved to `mx.sym.linalg.*` and `mx.sym.random.*`. The old names are still available but deprecated.
  - `sample_*` and `random_*` are now merged as `random.*`, which supports both scalar and  `NDArray` distribution parameters.
### Bug-fixes
  - Fixed a bug that causes `argsort` operator to fail on large tensors.
  - Fixed numerical stability issues when summing large tensors.
  - Fixed a bug that causes arange operator to output wrong results for large ranges.
  - Improved numerical precision for unary and binary operators on `float64` inputs.

## 0.11.0
### Major Features
  - Apple Core ML model converter
  - Support for Keras v1.2.2
  - For more information see [full release notes](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/v0.11.0+Release+Notes)
### API Changes
  - Added `CachedOp`. You can now cache the operators thatâ€™s called frequently with the same set of arguments to reduce overhead.
  - Added sample_multinomial for sampling from multinomial distributions.
  - Added `trunc` operator for rounding towards zero.
  - Added linalg_gemm, linalg_potrf, ... operators for lapack support.
  - Added verbose option to Initializer for printing out initialization details.
  - Added DeformableConvolution to contrib from the Deformable Convolutional Networks paper.
  - Added float64 support for dot and batch_dot operator.
  - `allow_extra` is added to Module.set_params to ignore extra parameters.
  - Added `mod` operator for modulo.
  - Added `multi_precision` option to SGD optimizer to improve training with float16. Resnet50 now achieves the same accuracy when trained with float16 and gives 50% speedup on Titan XP.
### Performance Improvements
  - ImageRecordIter now stores data in pinned memory to improve GPU memcopy speed.
### Bugfixes
  - Cython interface is fixed. `make cython` and `python setup.py install --with-cython` should install the cython interface and reduce overhead in applications that use imperative/bucketing.
  - Fixed various bugs in Faster-RCNN example: https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/pull/6486
  - Fixed various bugs in SSD example.
  - Fixed `out` argument not working for `zeros`, `ones`, `full`, etc.

  - Fixed a few race conditions that causes crashes on shutdown.
### Refactors
  - Refactored TShape/TBlob to use int64 dimensions and DLTensor as internal storage. Getting ready for migration to DLPack. As a result TBlob::dev_mask_ and TBlob::stride_ are removed.
